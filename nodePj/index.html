		<p>The strict definition of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves and the consequent release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name "Heinrich event" can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their <a href="/wiki/Abrupt_climate_change" title="Abrupt climate change">abrupt</a> onset may occur in mere years (Maslin <i>et al</i>. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point makes it more difficult to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond &amp; Lotti 1995) identify the <a href="/wiki/Younger_Dryas" title="Younger Dryas">Younger Dryas</a> event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (<i>table, right</i>).
